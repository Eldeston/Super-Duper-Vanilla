## Block id system should be flexible especially when it comes to modded blocks (user inputs)
## Block names should not be duplicated even in other block ids
## Block names must not use their legacy names (below 1.13)
## Block ids without assigned blocks are for user inputs
## Maximum block id is capped at 32767
